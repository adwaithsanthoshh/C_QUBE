Using `chunk_length_s` is very experimental with seq2seq models. The results will not necessarily be entirely accurate and will have caveats. More information: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/20104. Ignore this warning with pipeline(..., ignore_warning=True). To use Whisper for long-form transcription, use rather the model's `generate` method directly as the model relies on it's own chunking mechanism (cf. Whisper original paper, section 3.8. Long-form Transcription).

gen_text 2 resulting in happier users and increased engagement. I'm passionate about building efficient and user-friendly applications."
